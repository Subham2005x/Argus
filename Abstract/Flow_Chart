#ESP32-CAM Captures an Image:

The ESP32-CAM captures an image of a person standing in front of it.
It sends the image to the Flask server via an HTTP POST request.

#Server Receives the Image:

The Flask server receives the image and processes it.

#Face Detection and Recognition:

The server uses a face detection model (e.g., MTCNN) to locate the face in the image.
It then extracts facial embeddings (a numerical representation of the face) using a facial recognition model (e.g., FaceNet).

#Match Face with Database:

The server compares the extracted facial embeddings with the embeddings stored in the database.
If a match is found, the server identifies the user.

#Log Attendance:

The server logs the attendance by saving the user's ID and the current timestamp in the database.

#Send Response to ESP32-CAM:

The server sends a response back to the ESP32-CAM
