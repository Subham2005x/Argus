# Attendance System Using Facial Recognition

## Project Overview
Traditional attendance systems are time-consuming and error-prone. This project aims to automate attendance using facial recognition, providing a contactless and efficient solution.

### Objectives:
- Develop a user-friendly interface.
- Implement facial recognition for accurate identification.
- Store attendance records in a structured format.
- Automate the attendance process seamlessly.

## Technologies and Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python (due to its simplicity and extensive library support).
- **Tools:** Visual Studio Code, Git/GitHub, ESP-32 Cam .
- **Libraries:**
  - **OpenCV**: For facial detection and recognition.
  - **Pillow**: For image processing and handling.
  - **CSV**: For storing attendance records.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical computations.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/attendance-system.git
   cd attendance-system
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install opencv-python numpy pillow
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage
- Launch the application and use the GUI to register students' faces.
- The system will recognize and mark attendance automatically.
- Attendance records will be stored in a CSV file.
