   <!-- FUTURE PLANS SECTION -->
   <section class="future-plans" id="future-plans">
    <h2>Future Plans</h2>
    <p>The Automatic Attendance System leveraging CAM module and facial recognition provides a robust, low-cost solution for automated attendance tracking. However, the project’s potential can be significantly enhanced by integrating more advanced technologies under the guidance of experts. Scaling the system requires incorporating cutting-edge tools to improve accuracy, security, and overall performance.</p>
    
    <h3>1. Machine Learning & AI Integration: </h3>
    <p><strong>Enhanced Facial Recognition:</strong> The system can be further refined by utilizing deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. These frameworks can be used to create custom models that improve face recognition accuracy in varying lighting conditions, angles, and occlusions.</p>
    <p><strong>Behavioral Analytics:</strong> With the implementation of AI algorithms, the system could analyze user behavior, predict attendance patterns, and identify trends such as frequent absenteeism or tardiness. This could lead to proactive solutions in workplace or classroom environments.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Cloud-Based Architecture for Scalability: </h3>
    <p><strong>Cloud Storage:</strong> By moving from local databases (SQLite/MySQL) to cloud storage platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure, the system can scale to handle larger volumes of data and multiple locations. Cloud services would also enable remote monitoring and management, offering administrators the ability to track attendance across different campuses or offices.</p>
    <p><strong>Real-Time Synchronization:</strong> Cloud integration allows for real-time synchronization of data, ensuring consistency and up-to-date attendance logs, even when multiple devices are in use.</p>
    
    <h3>3. Mobile Application & IoT Integration: </h3>
    <p><strong>Mobile App:</strong> Developing a mobile app could allow users to mark attendance using their smartphones, enhancing accessibility and user engagement. Push notifications could remind users to check in, and mobile-based attendance tracking could extend the system to more diverse environments (e.g., fieldwork, off-site employees).</p>
    <p><strong>IoT Sensors:</strong> Integrating IoT devices such as temperature, humidity, or motion sensors could optimize the system’s performance. For example, cameras could automatically adjust to environmental conditions, ensuring accurate facial recognition.</p>
    
    <h3>4. Blockchain for Security and Data Integrity: </h3>
    <p><strong>Tamper-Proof Records:</strong> Incorporating blockchain technology can enhance data security by creating immutable attendance logs. This ensures the integrity of the attendance data, making it tamper-proof and verifiable by any stakeholders. This feature would be particularly useful for institutions that require a high level of data security and transparency.</p>
    
    <h4>Building the Automatic Attendance System into a Business Model</h4>
    <p>By integrating these advanced technologies, the Automatic Attendance System can be transformed into a scalable, secure, and efficient solution that meets the needs of various institutions. This can open up new business opportunities and create a sustainable model for growth and innovation.</p>

    <h3>Target Market Identification: </h3>
    <p><strong>Educational Institutions:</strong> Schools, colleges, and universities are prime candidates for automated attendance systems, as they often deal with large student populations and need accurate attendance tracking for academic records.</p>
    <p><strong>Corporations and Businesses:</strong> Offices and companies seeking to streamline attendance and improve workplace efficiency would benefit from this system. The system can be expanded to integrate with employee management and payroll systems.</p>
    <p><strong>Event Management:</strong> For conferences, seminars, or large gatherings, the system could be used to track attendee participation without the need for manual check-ins.</p>

    <h3>Monetization Strategies: </h3>
    <p><strong>Subscription Model:</strong> Offering the system as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) could provide a steady revenue stream. Schools, businesses, and other institutions could pay a monthly or yearly subscription fee for access to the system, with tiered pricing based on the number of users or features.</p>
    <p><strong>Custom Solutions:</strong> Offering customization services for organizations that require tailored features (e.g., integration with existing systems, unique UI design) can be another revenue stream.</p>
    <p><strong>Hardware Sales:</strong> By partnering with hardware manufacturers, the project could include the sale of ESP32-CAM modules or even more advanced camera solutions, offering a comprehensive attendance package.</p>

    <h3>Value Proposition for Customers: </h3>
    <p><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> The system’s use of affordable components like the ESP32-CAM and open-source software makes it more cost-effective compared to expensive commercial biometric solutions.</p>
    <p><strong>Scalability & Flexibility:</strong> The system can scale from small classrooms to large enterprises, allowing users to expand the solution as their needs grow. Its modular nature ensures that users can integrate new features or adapt it to different environments.</p>
    <p><strong>Improved Security & Privacy:</strong> With the integration of blockchain and local data storage options, customers can be assured that their attendance data is secure and tamper-proof, avoiding the risks associated with cloud-based third-party storage.</p>
